## The Roommate: YanXin
Xiaoyi has a roommate named **YanXin**. Although they share the same living space, their relationship is about to take a turn for the worse. YanXin, without Xiaoyi's knowledge or permission, made a decision that would impact both Fish and Xiaoyi.

## The Unexpected Sale
To Xiaoyi's dismay, YanXin decided to sell Fish to someone else. This decision was made unilaterally and without consulting Xiaoyi. As you can imagine, Xiaoyi was heartbroken and deeply unhappy about the situation. Fish was more than just a pet; it was a cherished friend and companion.

## Parting Ways
Given the unfortunate turn of events, Xiaoyi made a tough decision. It was clear that living with YanXin was no longer an option. Therefore, Xiaoyi decided to part ways and no longer live with YanXin. It was a difficult choice, but one that Xiaoyi felt was necessary to move forward.
